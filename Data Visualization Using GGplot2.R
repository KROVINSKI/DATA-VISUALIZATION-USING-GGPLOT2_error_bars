## Title: DATA VISUALIZATION USING GGPLOT2
## Date: April 2020

# R script below follows the tutorial on how to assign error bars in GGplot

# Error Bars are used to visualize the variability of the plotted data. 
# Error Bars can be applied to graphs such as, 
#                                           Dot Plots, 
#                                           Barplots, or 
#                                           Line Graphs 
#                             to provide an additional layer of detail on the presented data.

#Generally, Error bars are used to show either the standard deviation, 
#                             standard error, confidence intervals or interquartile range.

# The length of an Error Bar helps reveal the uncertainty of a data point: 
#                             a short Error Bar shows that values are concentrated, 
#                             signalling that the plotted average value is more likely, 
#                             while a long Error Bar would indicate that the values 
#                                            are more spread out and less reliable.
